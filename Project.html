    <p>My go-to lemon loaf recipe for years! This delicious Glazed Lemon Pound Cake Loaf is always Perfectly moist and lemony!</p>
    <p>I have been making this same lemon loaf for years. It's my "go to" when only lemon loaf will do. The fact that I've never posted it to this point is simply my belief that maybe the internet didnt really need another lemon loaf recipe. But what the heck. It's good,it's tried and tested (many,many times!) and for anyone who has yet to find their"go to" lemon loaf, it's definitely worthy of consederation.</p>

    <h3>Cook's Notes</h3>

    <P>When it comes to baking loaves like this one, there is really just one secret to success. Follow the instructions: Take it from someone who has (in the past:) skipped certainj instructions like "at room temperature", "whisk together well in a seperated bowl" and "add alternately"...yet had what i considered (at the time) to be a reasonably fine result</P>
